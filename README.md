# Javascript Maze Generator

This is a (slightly bad) maze generator written in P5.js that I build for an independant project in 9th grade. The generator uses a recursize backtracking algorithm that tends to get very slow as the maze size increases. An example maze generated by the code is shown below. Enjoy!

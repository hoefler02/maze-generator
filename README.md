# Javascript Maze Generator

This is a (slightly bad) maze generator written in P5.js that I build for an independant project in 9th grade. The generator uses a recursize backtracking algorithm that tends to get very slow as the maze size increases. An example maze generated by the code is shown below. Keep in mind, the below image was generated without the green start and red finish squares. Enjoy!
